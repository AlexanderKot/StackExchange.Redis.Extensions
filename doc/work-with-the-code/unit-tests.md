# Unit tests

The reliability of an application is extremely important for this reason, thanks to the open source community, we have more than 2500 unit tests over 4 different target frameworks around this library.

If you find a bug, will be nice to have a unit test the replicate the problem, so we can fix it and prevent regression in the future.
